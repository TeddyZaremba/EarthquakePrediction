# Earthquake Prediction
-   Analyzed Bay Area earthquake data between 1990 and 2018 from the UC Berkeley Seismology Lab
-   Analyzed how the size of the dataset, time interval for predictions, and minimum earthquake magnitude affected the prediction accuracy
- Used a random forrest and linear regression for prediction
- All the details are in the .ipynb file
